# Cub3D Project

## 📌 Project Overview

**Cub3D** is a foundational 42 school project designed to develop your skills in low-level programming and graphic rendering. This project challenges you to build a basic 3D engine using the **raycasting** technique, similar to the one used in early first-person games like *Wolfenstein 3D*.

## 🎯 Objectives

This project reinforces several key goals from the first year of programming, including:

- Rigor and structure in software development  
- Mastery of the **C programming language**  
- Implementation of **basic algorithms**  
- Research and self-learning  
- Clean and efficient code organization

## 🖼️ Graphic Programming Skills

As a graphic design-focused project, Cub3D introduces students to:

- Creating and managing graphical **windows**  
- Handling **keyboard and mouse events**  
- Using **colors and textures**  
- Drawing and **filling 2D shapes** to simulate 3D effects

## 🧠 Mathematics as a Tool

While advanced math is not required, Cub3D is an excellent opportunity to explore the **practical applications of mathematics** in a fun and visual way. Through raycasting and vector calculations, you will:

- Understand how geometry and angles drive 3D rendering  
- Use math to design elegant and performant algorithms  
- Apply mathematical logic without deep theoretical study

## 🌐 Learning & Resources

There are countless resources and tutorials online to help you understand raycasting, game loops, and graphical APIs. Cub3D encourages:

- Self-driven learning  
- Curiosity and experimentation  
- A blend of creativity and technical precision

## 🧩 Conclusion

Cub3D is more than just a coding assignment—it’s an interactive and rewarding experience that combines math, graphics, and software design. It offers a solid base for future game development, graphics programming, and real-time rendering.
